⚠️ Challenges Faced & Solutions Implemented
🔴 Challenge 1: Extracting accurate tasks & events
Problem: The initial implementation extracted static responses instead of real-time actions.
Solution: Improved NLP patterns to dynamically extract relevant phrases from speech.

🔴 Challenge 2: Storing & displaying extracted actions
Problem: Tasks & events were not persisting properly across pages.
Solution: Implemented localStorage to store & retrieve extracted actions seamlessly.

🔴 Challenge 3: Limited time for development
Problem: Due to tight deadlines, completing features on time was a challenge.
Solution: Leveraged AI tools to speed up debugging, optimize code, and improve efficiency.

📌 Future Improvements
🔹 Integrate AI-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) for better accuracy.
🔹 Add support for multiple languages & accents.
🔹 Enhance UI with drag-and-drop task management.
🔹 Implement a cloud-based database for saving tasks permanently.
